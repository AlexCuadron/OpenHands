# Changes Made to the MATH-500 Benchmark

## Overview

The MATH-500 benchmark was already implemented in the repository, but we've made some improvements to make it more general and reusable.

## Changes Made

1. Added a `solution` parameter to the `AgentFinishAction` class:
   - This provides a more general way to include a solution or answer in the finish action
   - The parameter is optional, so it won't break existing code

2. Updated the MATH-500 benchmark to use the new `solution` parameter:
   - Modified the `function_calling.py` file to set both the `outputs` dictionary and the `solution` parameter
   - Updated the `extract_answer_from_history` function to check for the solution parameter first, then fall back to the outputs dictionary
   - Added tests to verify that the solution parameter works correctly

3. Updated the documentation:
   - Added information about the solution parameter to the README.md file
   - Added comments to the code to explain the changes

## Benefits

1. More explicit API for providing solutions:
   - Instead of using a generic outputs dictionary, agents can now use a dedicated parameter for solutions
   - This makes the code more readable and self-documenting

2. Backward compatibility:
   - The benchmark still works with agents that use the outputs dictionary
   - Existing code doesn't need to be changed

3. Better testability:
   - Added tests to verify that the solution parameter works correctly
   - The tests ensure that the benchmark will continue to work with both old and new agents

## Future Work

1. Update other benchmarks to use the solution parameter:
   - The solution parameter can be used by other benchmarks that require a final answer or solution
   - This would provide a more consistent API across benchmarks

2. Update the agent documentation:
   - Add information about the solution parameter to the agent documentation
   - Provide examples of how to use it
